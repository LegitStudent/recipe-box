# Recipe Box
> A recipe storage app made with love and React.

This project was first developed in [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/highrollersuite/pen/ZLadoy). As the project got more complicated, the "development environment" offered by codepen became too limiting. The project was eventually taken offline in a local development environment bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Features
  * Record the ingredients of your favorite recipes.
  * Update and delete the records of your recipes.
  * Each record is locally stored in your browser. Closing your browser won't make them disappear.
